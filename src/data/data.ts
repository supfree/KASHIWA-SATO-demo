    title: "UNIQLO LOGO STORE",
    desc:
      "<p>Kashiwa Sato worked on the complete production and architectural design of UNIQLO LOGO STORE, UNIQLO’s new suburban roadside store. At the corner of the building is a huge 7m x 7m cube-shaped logo that provides iconic brand communication, while inside there are new brand features such as a florist shop, cafe, and play area. This is a global prototype for local roadside stores that bring communities together, presenting a new kind of evolved store space. In this era when online shopping is the norm and customers can buy UNIQLO clothes without even visiting a physical store, creative director Kashiwa Sato and UNIQLO CEO Tadashi Yanai have for the past 10 years been discussing ways of evolving roadside stores to make it worthwhile and meaningful for customers to visit, and one solution was to produce this new roadside UNIQLO LOGO STORE as an open venue to society that communicates information with the brand symbol at its core. UNIQLO LOGO STORE is positioned as a prototype of a new kind of roadside store to be developed globally, maintaining the basic design concept while adjusting the size depending on each site environment, providing a single-story steel construction measuring approximately 57m x 50m with a height of approximately 8m. The logo cube, which measures roughly 7m on each side, supports the roof. This is a large store with a total floor area exceeding 2,700㎡.UNIQLO’s current logo was designed by Kashiwa Sato in 2006. The logo is an icon of the UNIQLO brand and is positioned as the brand concept and vision. The huge 7m x 7m cube-shaped logo at the corner of the building produces an environmental space symbolizing the future activities of UNIQLO, not only as a sign but also by containing new elements of experience-based services that will be required going forward to differentiate real-world stores from online shopping.Features include UNIQLO FLOWER BOX, which sells flowers throughout the four seasons, a UNIQLO COFFEE BOX area where customers can sample locally produced delicacies and coffee, and a UNIQLO KIDS BOX area featuring playfully-designed cushions shaped like letters that spell out &#8220;UNIQLO,&#8221; a picture book corner and slide where children can play freely. This area features displays that present UNIQLO’s environmental conservation activities in a kid-friendly way. In UNIQLO GARDEN, a green space surrounding the building, there are uniquely-designed benches, desks, and parasols. This free and open space can be used to take a break from shopping or to have a family picnic, with various local events also set to be held here. Also, the RE.UNIQLO STUDIO clothing reuse, recycle, repair, and remake service has been adopted in Japan for the first time as a permanent service at this store. A culture of treating clothes with care will also be transmitted through SASHIKO by UNIQLO, which provides repairs based on traditional Japanese sashiko embroidery and UTme!, where customers can design their own T-shirts. In addition to selling clothes, the store as a whole provides a space that embodies the concept of “LifeWear” (a UNIQLO corporate slogan) with the aim of making clothes to enrich the lives of all by providing spaces and services with greater comfort and enjoyment.In order to meet the target of zero greenhouse gas emissions by the year 2050, the company aims to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions in its own store and office operations by 90% by 2030 (compared to 2019 levels), in line with which the UNIQLO LOGO STORE incorporates a number of features designed to help minimize energy usage. Above the clear glass façades inserted into the red logo cubes positioned at three of the building’s corners are long eaves approximately 3.8m deep. This is a very simple structure, but it reduces the need for air-conditioning by providing shade from solar radiation in summertime and bringing in natural heat during the winter months when the sun is low. Combined with the skylights in the ceiling at the center of the store, this also works to provide natural lighting in winter, and the combination of rooftop solar panels and the latest air-conditioning technology has made it possible to reduce electricity consumption by approximately 40%. The building’s exterior walls are insulated in part with recycled materials from shredded UNIQLO clothing donated by customers, with this material amounting to approximately 30% of all the insulating material used in the building.Perceiving the store space as a form of media to communicate brand information, the UNIQLO LOGO STORE will transmit products, services and corporate initiatives to society, representing a prototype for global roadside UNIQLO stores going forward with a new kind of evolved commercial space.</p>\n",

    title: "KURA SUSHI TAIWAN",
    desc:
      "<p>Kashiwa Sato designed the first global flagship restaurant outside of Japan launched by major conveyor belt sushi chain Kura Sushi in Kaohsiung, Taiwan. Following the design of the flagship stores in Japan, Kura Sushi Taiwan features the latest evolution of a space concept that revives the original Edo Period scene of &#8220;food and entertainment&#8221; inspired by a scene from Hiroshige Utagawa&#8217;s &#8220;Famous Views of the Eastern Capital, Amusements While Waiting for the Moon on the Twenty-sixth Night at Takanawa&#8221; in which merchants casually enjoy sushi at a food stall. This is the first architectural project for a flagship store. The building is the largest Kura Sushi restaurant in the world, with a large roof tiled with kawara, a traditional material used in Japanese architecture, wooden exterior walls, an open space with a plain wood ceiling more than 6 meters high, and with a seating capacity of 288. The front of the building has a colorful, luminous 200-piece &#8220;lantern wall&#8221; that gives the impression of a lively festival to the city. Along the side of the building, which is more than 20 meters long, is a menu graphic in the style of a sumo wrestling rankings table, a symbol of Edo merchant culture and highly compatible with Japanese food. Upon entering the restaurant, one is greeted by a large 3-meter-high lantern and a water basin approximately 3 meters in diameter in the shape of the family crest of Kura Sushi. In the waiting area, there is a space decorated with massive ukiyo-e woodblock prints by Hiroshige Utagawa and lanterns, and a lively entertainment area where customers can experience Japanese festival culture, including a shooting game and thousand-strings lottery stalls. The seating area is made of plain wood and is integrated with a simple Japanese modern design that is both luxurious and comfortable. Seating is gently partitioned by timberwork and white noren curtains, providing semi-private rooms that also serves as a COVID-19 countermeasure, and the chairs are made of tatami mats for a relaxed dining experience.The restaurant is also actively involved in environmental protection and has obtained Green Restaurant Certification from the Agriculture Bureau of Kaohsiung City Government. This system is designed to promote local production for local consumption and the production and consumption of safe agricultural products. To be certified, restaurants must pass evaluations in six categories: energy conservation, environmental protection, green and safe food, green initiatives, health and safety management, and sustainable management. The building materials adopted here also are environmentally friendly materials, and the materials used for the walls and ceilings have acquired the Green Building Material label issued by the TAIWAN Architecture &#038; Building Center and the Green Mark Program issued by the Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) of Taiwan. Kura Sushi was founded by its president Kunihiko Tanaka, who as a child saw a Japanese warehouse (kura) and wondered and dreamed about what was inside. He started the restaurant under the name Kura Sushi with the hope that customers would come to the restaurant with a sense of wonder. His desire is to &#8220;please people and make them happy,&#8221; and that &#8220;happy smiles are created by eating delicious food along with enjoyable experiences.&#8221; To deliver this message to people around the world, this environmental space in Taiwan was created as the latest in Japanese conveyor belt sushi culture, combining food and entertainment.</p>\n",

      "<p>Kashiwa Sato provided total direction and design, including total production, naming, logo, architectural and interior design supervision of JOYHON PARK, a new ultra-large flagship store of Joyful Honda, which operates large home improvement centers in the Kanto region. For the name of the new flagship store, he proposed the brand name JOYHON, which customers were already familiar with. The logo design depicts the accumulation of a wide variety of materials at Joyful Honda, which has a massive product lineup and stock volume to meet the needs of professionals and local residents, as well as the excitement and fun that the company provides to all generations by inspiring intellectual creativity with its concept of &#8220;bringing entertainment into everyday life.” Taking the motif from the birthplace of Joyful Honda, which has provided customers with a rich lineup of lumber since its founding, the exterior of the building adopts a wooden tone that harmonizes with the rich natural environment of the surrounding area. The interior is also decorated in the same manner, with floors, walls, and ceilings all using wood, creating a relaxing environment that encourages customers to spend a long time in the spacious interior of the store.In the parking lot, 3-meter-high, 31-meter-long logo art was installed as the new JOYHON PARK icon. The lawn area where this artwork is situated also features food trucks and benches, providing an event space and a brand space that enriches the relationship with the local community.</p>\n",

      "<p>Kashiwa Sato oversaw complete production of the YANMAR TOKYO complex in Yaesu, Tokyo, including design supervision for HANASAKA SQUARE, logo design, and artwork. Various spatial expressions were attempted based on the theme of “HANASAKA”, which embodies the values at the foundation of all YANMAR activities, originating with the spirit of YANMAR’s founder, Magokichi Yamaoka. The HANASAKA logo is designed in conjunction with YANMAR’s “FLYING-Y” brand mark, expressing HANASAKA as a concept produced on the basis of YANMAR’s core spirit. The “HANASAKA THE FUTURE” art installation dynamically filling the HANASAKA SQUARE atrium, which extends from the first floor underground to the second floor above ground, consists of 6,000 cherry blossoms made from washi (Japanese paper) and stainless steel. The “HANASAKA: THE LOGO” logo art, the symbol of this project, was produced with stainless steel on a wood panel. The “YANMAR RICE GALLERY” on the ground floor was designed as a space for learning about the past and present of rice production and stimulating thinking about the future of rice production in a hands-on experience-based gallery using digital technology with the theme of rice as Japan’s food culture. Young and old alike can enjoy learning here thanks to features such as a “Rice personality assessment” where one’s own personality can be assessed by linking to varieties of rice, a “Wisdom behind rice production” game in which players look for the answers to rice production-related questions, and a “Rice cuisine map” touch panel showing recipes and trivia for rice cuisines around the world. Rice straw is used for the interior finishing materials of the exhibition space, and visitors can experience the wonders of rice not only from the contents but also from the design of the space. YANMAR’s “FLYING-Y” symbol is also produced with rice straw, communicating the brand in an iconic manner. Various other contents and activities &#8211; including the ASTERISCO rice-based Italian restaurant, the KOME-SHIN store where visitors can find their ideal rice, and SAKEICE Tokyo Shop, a specialist store serving ice cream infused with sake – have been developed and established on the basis of YANMAR’s core HANASAKA values and the theme of rice, attracting attention as a new type of space branding in which a head office building is perceived as a form of media.</p>\n",

    title: "GLP ALFALINK",
    desc:
      "<p>Kashiwa Sato was involved in the entire development of GLP ALFALINK Sagamihara, one of the largest advanced logistics centers in Japan with a total floor area of about 670,000 m2 developed by GLP Japan. He directed and designed the total branding from concept development, naming, logo, and a shared facility building called “RING” to supervising the design of the landscape. While logistics is becoming a form of social infrastructure and is growing in importance, recent years have brought major social issues such as connection with local communities, responding to technological advancements, and securing human resources. Considering this multifunctional large-scale logistics center, one of the largest in Japan, as a flagship facility, GLP Japan entrusted Kashiwa Sato with the overall direction of the project that would redefine the significance of logistics with a new approach.Kashiwa Sato adopted the concept of an open hub and pursued a style of next-generation logistics that is open toward the community and society at all tiers from information dissemination to construction. He aimed to build a community of co-creation that will become a part of a rich everyday life where people, goods, and information cross paths. This involves both co-creation with the community and co-creation among customer companies. It will become a place of rest and relaxation loved by the local residents as well as a place where new encounters, exchanges, and business opportunities are created one after another for customer companies. The tagline – “a logistics platform that creates a chain of creation” – defines these goals, and a variety of creation has been developed. The brand name, ALFALINK, expresses the idea of generating something extra for the future of logistics by connecting and chaining all things. The logo is based on light green representing land and light blue representing ocean and sky, expressing the chain of creation that seamlessly connects land, ocean, and sky. Two lines represent the flow of new people, goods, information, and value that are generated from ALFALINK as a starting point and continue to spread without stopping even for a moment. A 10-meter high artwork of the logo was installed at the entrance of the facility as an iconic symbol of the brand.For ALFALINK, the facility itself is considered an important medium for branding, and Kashiwa Sato pursued the idea of “visionizing” – something that goes beyond the idea of visualization. He designed different parts of the facility to widely communicate the best logistics quality to customers and consumers and to create a significant corporate branding effect. The shared facility building named “RING” is a circular structure with a diameter of 86 meters and a height of 10 meters, featuring a motif of the logo design. It is an open structure building with glass facade and connects each warehouse building with a sidewalk and deck, which are also designed using the curves of the logo as a motif. It is a space that truly represents the idea of an open hub. In addition to restaurants, the building includes a daycare center, a convenience store, and conference rooms and is open to those who work at ALFALINK as well as to the local residents. The central lawned garden square and vehicle traffic lines co-exist while ensuring safety, and the scenery expresses diversity, the core of the open hub concept, by simultaneously bringing together logistics and users’ activities. Various events and festivals are held around the RING on a regular basis. The adjacent multi-purpose court is also open to the public, and local youth soccer classes and other events are held here. The facility is designed to be a popular place in the community and to influence CSR and recruitment of customer companies. In the event of a disaster, it will become an evacuation site in cooperation with the local government, and at the same time BCP measures are strengthened to support the unstoppable logistics of customer companies. A larger co-creation community is created by strengthening cooperation not only between companies but also with the community, and it has become a concept model for the relationship between logistics and society in the coming era.</p>\n",

      "<p>Kashiwa Sato provided complete direction and design of the total production, naming, logo, packaging, and storefront for the Hong Kong-based brand of OMUSUBI rice balls using Japanese rice. While sushi is known throughout the world as a Japanese food, few people are aware of omusubi. The name of the new brand, OMUSUBI, was chosen based on Hyakunousha’s desire to take the food culture of omusubi and spread it worldwide. The logo design consists of the word “OMUSUBI” and a red triangle icon inspired by the shape of omusubi. The triangle embraces the concept of sanpo-yoshi (three-way satisfaction), an ancient Japanese business custom that benefits not only the seller and the buyer, but also society. The red brand color expresses the “blessings of the sun&#8221; and the “heart-warming spirit that omusubi kindly bring to people and the earth.” White wrapping paper was used to unify the product packaging, producing a safe and reliable product display with a sense of luxury. The store space was designed with a simple material composition of brass, white curtains, and plain wood based on a motif of gold ears of rice in a bountiful harvest, the white of white rice, and the wood of the rice-tub that holds the cooked rice, creating an iconic space with a sense of both modernity and traditional Japaneseness. A proactive approach to sustainability has also been adopted with the introduction of recyclable product packaging by changing the wrapping paper and actively using brass and wood in its interior design, thereby significantly reducing the use of plastic compared to previous stores.</p>\n",

      '<p class="p1">Kashiwa Sato took charge of all global branding communication activities for Uniqlo, a global leading fashion brand from Tokyo, starting with the opening of the flagship store in 2006, ‘UNIQLO SOHO NEW YORK.’ To realize the unique creative and design foundation of Uniqlo, he established the core branding concept “super rationality with aesthetic consciousness,” which summarizes Uniqlo’s value proposition to the world: high-quality products at affordable prices. Kashiwa also created a visual identity by modifying Japanese katakana and original fonts, and organized expert teams of architects, interior designers, and graphic artists to design and promote the same tone and feel for each of the flagship store in London, Paris, Shanghai, Tokyo, and Berlin.  This total communication strategy, which was directly connected to Uniqlo’s overall business management, lifted the Uniqlo brand globally. The logo of Uniqlo’s very first global flagship store in Soho, New York City, utilized the vivid red of the original Uniqlo logo, and katakana and English to express how Uniqlo transforms casual wear originating in Europe and the US to Japanese tastes.  The overall graphic design, comprised of the logo and original fonts, was the core of the communication strategy, which was used on “under-construction” panels, yellow cab roofs, and a variety of media to encourage awareness of the logo and of the Uniqlo brand. Kashiwa also organized a global professional creative team with Masamichi Katayama of “Wonderwall,”  who designed the interiors of many of Uniqlo’s flagship stores, and Yugo Nakamura of ‘tha ltd’, who designed their websites.  He also worked with Markus Kiersztan in New York, the creative collective at “Surface to Air” in Paris, and other creative partners to localize the Uniqlo brand and then spread it in such cities as Paris, London, Berlin, Moscow and Shanghai, and to present the most current Japanese pop culture to the world. Uniqlo’s T-shirt brand, UT, was the main concept of the Harajuku flagship store when it opened in 2007.  Kashiwa produced the concept and named it “UT”. He also created the ”T-shirt in a bottle,” which conveyed “the future convenience store of T-shirts.” For +J, Uniqlo’s collaboration with the world famous fashion designer Jil Sander, Kashiwa and Sander chose to open the flagship store in Paris and to announce the +J brand launch both on the first day of Paris Fashion Week.  This communication strategy resulted in strong coverage from the international media and fashion journalists and helped Uniqlo gain recognition as a global brand. In addition to his work on the global strategy for thermal inner wear to clearly position its quick-dry function, ”Heat Tech,” Kashiwa went beyond the framework of a conventional creative director by demonstrating a new possibility for the company’s relationship with design through a series of exercises that directly connected management with creative work.</p>\n',

    title: "KASHIWA SATO EXHIBITION",
    desc:
      "<p>The Kashiwa Sato exhibition, which opened at the National Art Center, Tokyo from February 2021 and lasted for a period of about three months, was personally curated by Kashiwa himself, from the displays to the venue layout, to introduce approximately 30 years of his work in a multi-faceted approach.The National Art Center, Tokyo, has periodically featured design and architecture exhibitions aligning with its policy of “a museum which introduces various artistic expressions and raises new perspectives.” Thus, Kashiwa decided on the exhibition’s overall concept to widely communicate the work of branding and creative direction. From advertisements, including posters, pamphlets, and TV commercials, to branded products and PR content, he designed all the touch points of the exhibition in an attempt to visualize the essential value of creative direction.The exhibition was composed of six sections based on the expressive approaches of advertisement, logo, graphic design, branding, and art. The introductory section, THE SPACE WITHIN, displayed collages created by Kashiwa in his childhood, when he was fascinated by comic book (manga) covers and symbols such as logos and signs, as well as graphic works he had designed for the first time on a PC. In the following section, ADVERTISING AND BEYOND, various innovative advertising expressions created by Kashiwa since the 1990s, which regarded all things as medium for communicating information, were displayed on a dynamic scale similar to when they were first created.One of the exhibition highlights, THE LOGO, was a spectacular installation that materialized a number of logos previously designed by Kashiwa into immense paintings and objects. Furthermore, the section titled THE POWER OF GRAPHIC DESIGN introduced the foundation of Kashiwa’s creative thinking that is based on the power of graphic design through representative posters and book concepts. The following section, ICONIC BRANDING PROJECTS, utilized the perspective of icons to present branding projects of a wide range of areas that he had worked on since the mid-2000s.The final section, LINES / FLOW, focused on artwork originating from the Arita porcelain project Kashiwa had been working on in recent years. Two series are displayed in this section as a pair of installations: LINES, straight lines constructed geometrically, and FLOW, organic drawings created from splash painting. In his LINES series, consisted of large-scale stainless steel artwork and porcelain panels, Kashiwa expresses his interest in the straight line, something that is extremely conceptual and does not occur in the natural world. In the FLOW series, which consists of a series of drawings on large Japanese traditional paper (washi), video content, and installations from his previous Arita porcelain series DISSIMILAR, Kashiwa expresses his feelings of awe at the energy of nature which cannot be controlled by humans. These series together represent his personal perspective as a creator in pursuit of “beauty.”Additionally, Kashiwa presented a new form of co-creation in this exhibition through his collaborations with companies to create artwork. The UT STORE @ THE NATIONAL ART CENTER, TOKYO displayed not only the T-shirt designs, but also the purchasing experience at the store as a single piece of art. Also, the interactive digital installation UNLIMITED SPACE was created based on Rakuten’s technology, Rakuten being a company under which Kashiwa has served as chief creative director for many years.During the exhibition period, a satellite exhibition was held in Shanghai, along with a live stream original movie and video interview on YouTube, all organized as part of the official Kashiwa Sato exhibition. This exhibition, with its meta-structure of viewing the entire exhibition itself as a piece of “art,” achieved high acclaim through its innovative approach of surpassing the framework of conventional design exhibitions that look back on the past achievements of creators. Despite the restrictions put in place due to the spread of COVID-19, the exhibition saw over 150,000 visitors and achieved great success in attendance.</p>\n",

      "<p>Kashiwa collaborated with architect Mr. Sou Fujimoto on the development of UNIQLO Park, Yokohama Bayside store. Mr. Fujimoto was in charge of the basic concept and design while Kashiwa worked with the grand concept and total comprehensive production of the project.Building on the grand concept of “a store building itself becoming a park, open to the local community,&#8221; this store is UNIQLO’s venture to create a “destination store,” a new conceptualization of a store that is “a place customers will want to visit to have fun.”The UNIQLO Park is a building three stories high that overlooks Yokohama Bayside Marina, in a wide and spacious area. Mainly targeting families, the shape of the building is a large slope that can be climbed from the ground floor to the rooftop. The exterior of all three floors make up the “park” with various playground equipment, including wide slides, bouldering walls, and rope jungle gyms. Many visitors can be seen freely enjoying the facilities.While considered a form of media, this integration of a park and a shop combines together different aspects of our lives, thus embodying UNIQLO’s idea of “LifeWear”. The fusion of a business with a public area creates a lifestyle fitting for this new form of space, attracting much attention.In April 2020, a revision of the Design Act in Japan was passed, allowing architectural and interior designs to be registered by the Japan Patent Office, and this project became a huge sensation as one of the first of its kind to be patented in Japan.</p>\n",

    title: "THE FUTURE OF HOUSING COMPLEX PROJECT",
    desc:
      '<p class="p1">Since its inception, Kashiwa Sato has served as Project Director for the revitalization of Yokohama<span class="s1">’</span>s Yokodai public housing complex, a model Urban Renaissance Agency project in Kanagawa Prefecture aimed at creating future modes of living and community frameworks. It has been planned as a long-term initiative; looking to make the project a progressive movement, he proposed to give it a name that would clearly set forth goals many people could agree on.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Taking the Kanji character 団 (one of the two characters in <span class="s1">“</span>public housing complex<span class="s1">”</span>; on its own, it means <span class="s1">“</span>group<span class="s1">”</span>) as the motif for the logo, Kashiwa rounded the corners to illustrate that the new complex would be a gentle, easy place to live. Then, for the issues facing the current aging, dilapidated complex, he used a dot (・) to represent individual ideas and a plus sign (+) to show that those ideas would be added one by one, alluding to the approach the project would take. Because substantive revitalization of a public housing complex is not only about reconstructing the physical buildings and facilities<span class="s1">—</span>it is also imperative to have suggestions around <span class="s1">“</span>soft<span class="s1">”</span> aspects, such as ideas and actions around lifestyle<span class="s1">—</span>Kashiwa specified <span class="s1">“</span>Architecture x Activities<span class="s1">”</span> as his keywords. Kengo Kuma, the Director of Architecture for this project, has designed buildings and spaces suited to new lifestyles, while Project Director Kashiwa Sato has led the initiative around <span class="s1">“</span>Architecture x Activities<span class="s1">”</span> to present new modes of living and community frameworks. As one aspect of <span class="s1">“</span>Architecture x Activities<span class="s1">”</span>, through discussions with experts, Kashiwa devised the TALKING open innovation platform to gather diverse local knowledge and experiences. A wide variety of discussions with professionals in disaster prevention, libraries, healthcare, robots, and more were recorded on the Web, resulting in concrete solutions for disaster-prevention activities, library facilities, etc. While engaging in these various discussions, Kashiwa discovered that the intrinsic value of a public housing complex is the power of gathering together to live, and set the goal for the entire project as maximizing that power. To accomplish this, he advocated for the concept of a <span class="s1">“</span>lifestyle cloud<span class="s1">”</span> patterned after approaches to data-sharing in the information and communications technology (ICT) field. Starting with the <span class="s1">“</span>Residential Complex Library,<span class="s1">”</span> a project to turn the entire complex into a library that originated from the TALKING platform, the many people who live in the complex are sharing information and experiences via public squares, parks, and event spaces, fostering communities and networks and creating a system that allows for maximum enjoyment of the merits of collective housing.On the infrastructure side, the renovation of the residential buildings and spaces by Mr. Kuma proceeded in sequence, and the “OPEN RING Public Residential Complex Gathering Place” he directed along with Mr. Kuma, based on the winning plan from the Yokodai Public Housing Complex Gathering Place Building Idea Competition, was completed. He simultaneously took on oversight for the design of the renovations to the far-side residential buildings and the outdoor square adjacent to the gathering place. The know-how gained from this project as it seeks to maximize the power in gathering together to live, achieved via the “Architecture x Activities” methodology that pioneered the use of open-innovation and sharing-economy concepts, is expected to revitalize public housing throughout the country in the years ahead. In addition, solutions that use collaborative creation to solve social issues are attracting attention as something that could be applied to a variety of the challenges faced by Japanese society, where social bonds within communities and neighborhoods have grown weak.</p>\n',

      '<p class="p1"><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Kashiwa Sato proposed to an innovative renewal project for Fuji Kindergarten to create the grand concept that the “Architecture of kindergarten itself is one gigantic playground.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And he gave new vision to the architecture as one medium for fostering every child’s creativity. Taking advantage of existing big Japanese elm trees on the site, Kashiwa proposed a circular building with a wooden roof on which the children could run and play everyday. </span><span style="line-height: 1.5;">The shape was more than a design choice; the middle area was allocated to a central courtyard to foster communal togetherness. Kashiwa also created the playground equipment, which was embedded in the architecture itself. His idea respected and reinforced the overall objective to make the kindergarten a “new interface of learning”. The idea that the ‘‘kindergarten is one gigantic playground” came from the thoughts and enthusiasm of Mr. </span>Sekiichi<span style="line-height: 1.5;"> Kato, chairman of Fuji Kindergarten. The project realized new possibility for a kindergarten education in Japan, where the birth rate is falling, by offering not just a cold “box” but a warm “place” surrounded by abundant nature, such as trees, soil, and fresh air. To take advantage of the nature on and surrounding the site, Kashiwa collaborated with Takaharu and Yui Tezuka, the husband-and-wife architectural team known for designing multi-use spaces that incorporate nature. Their building’s concept: “the space where no one is alone”. Many innovative ideas used in the kindergarten adhered to this concept.</span>  <span style="line-height: 1.5;">Ultimately, the circle shape building represents “infinity.” The roof serves as a second playground for children with more built-in equipment. They can run and play freely and then return to ground level by taking a slide or rope ladder. Even the water drainage system was designed for the children’s enjoyment; rainwater collected from the rooftop streams down in “waterfalls”. Kashiwa created paper cutout-like fonts and characters for the logo, the website, and the children’s T-shirt, which is not part of a typical kindergarten uniform. Representing the future of early childhood education under the concept of “Architecture of kindergarten itself is one gigantic playground, which fosters every child’s creativity,” this project was highly acclaimed internationally, earning the 2011 award for “Most Outstanding Facility” from the OECD Center for Effective Learning Environments (CELE) and numerous other global architectural and educational awards.</span></p>\n',

    title: "KURA SUSHI HARAJUKU",
    desc:
      '<p class="p1">As one aspect of leading conveyer-belt sushi chain Kura Sushi’s global branding, it placed its third global flagship store in Tokyo’s Harajuku neighborhood, the heart of Japan’s youth culture. We carried out all aspects of producing the store, including a new customer development strategy; site selection; store planning; the brand logo, interior design, and uniforms; and new product planning.As a brand developing businesses around the world, we aimed to convey the natural appeal of sushi, a food culture Japan is proud of, to the rest of the world in its most evolved form, as well as to provide a novel dining experience. Sushi is Japan’s first fast food, enjoyed at food stalls since the Edo Period. Utagawa Hiroshige’s ukiyo-e painting, “Amusements While Waiting for the Moon on the Night of the Twenty-sixth in Takanawa, a Famous Place in the Eastern Capital,” portrays Edo townspeople culture, showing food stalls with sushi, tempura, soba noodles, and sweets, people wearing octopus costumes, and people freely enjoying food under large canopies while men in trendy clothes and women dressed up like princesses swagger around. Interpreting this to mean that today’s conveyor-belt sushi shops should have the same kind of Edo-city bustle, we took this “Food x Entertainment” concept for the global flagship stores. The first flagship store, the Kura Sushi Asakusa ROX store, was praised for its highly unique design, and was certified as Registered Design No.1 under the amended Design Act that came into effect in April 2020. We designed the Kura Sushi Harajuku store using the concept of “Japan’s traditional food culture x Tokyo pop culture,” with a chrome-plated sweets stall placed at the center as its symbol. On the premise that it would spread through social media, we sold new products like sushi crepes and sweets from what looked like a DJ booth, and set up multiple photo backdrops including a chochin lantern wall, a logo wall, and a giant ukiyo-e painting. We presented an updated version of conveyor-belt sushi by providing a food experience unique to the space while allowing guests to become acquainted with Japanese traditions.</p>\n',

The theme for the design of the store was a combination of Kura Sushi’s DNA―an obsessive focus on providing safe food with peace of mind in a fun way―and communicating to the world the inherent appeal of sushi, a point of pride in Japan’s food culture. Inspired by one panel of Utagawa Hiroshige’s “Amusements While Waiting for the Moon on the Night of the Twenty-sixth in Takanawa, a Famous Place in the Eastern Capital” in which the townspeople of the Edo Period are enjoying sushi as fast food, Kashiwa Sato set the concept as a revival of this original “Food x Entertainment” scene for the modern age. The store interior, decorated with Hiroshige’s ukiyo-e artwork as well as countless masks and chochin lanterns, works in tandem with the interior roof and supports to evoke the spirit of a festival scaffold, and includes a “festival space” where guests can enjoy games like a shooting gallery and ring toss. Along with staging this exciting, festival-like space, we presented a worldview that allows foreigners to envision Japanese-style harmony through tatami-mat seats as well as walls, floors, tables, and chairs all crafted from plain wood. A giant chochin lantern with the company’s global logo hangs from the ceiling as a symbol of the store. The logo itself is a symbol of the Edo townspeople culture, combining Edo-style hiragana characters―which have a high affinity with Japanese food―with Western lettering that people throughout the world can recognize at a glance. In addition, we designed a new emblem inspired by the Namako wall pattern used on the outer walls of the warehouse (kura) that gives Kura Sushi its name, and based this emblem on the shapes of the “ku (く)” and “ra (ら)” hiragana characters. Starting with the complete design of this store―everything from making a space that maximized the unique Kura Sushi experience of a food-centered amusement park to a graphic seal that promotes the brand DNA and Japan’s proud food culture to the world―going forward we will continue to support the creative aspects of this brand’s overseas expansion push. This store’s design was registered as Japan’s first protected “interior design” under the April 2020 amendment to the Design Act. According to this amendment, in addition to conventional “goods,” structures, interior designs, and images are newly covered by design protections; while there were hundreds of registration applications, the Patent Office accepted only four in total, two structures and two interior designs. Among them, two of the projects were connected to Kashiwa Sato, iconic space branding efforts that instill a lasting impression. The design methods that he has been focusing on in recent years are being reevaluated in a positive light. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>\n',

Kashiwa was in charge of the interior design of their Aoyama office.Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, LIVNEX Group has been presented with the opportunity of creating a workplace for a new era with this new office. While the company has long been a proponent of new work styles, including remote work and flex-time systems, the Aoyama office allows them to accommodate to a more diverse selection of work styles.To align with society’s shift towards remote work and satellite offices, Kashiwa established the concept of the office as being a place for communication and presentations, rather than a place for work.He aimed to create a space for workers and the guests attending meetings that will allow and contribute to the creation of innovative ideas, as well as the growth and development of those ideas.The 20-meter long “communication space” is located at the center of the office and faces outward on all sides towards a scenic view, allowing in plenty of natural light. The floor, walls, and furniture are made from just a few types of building materials: wood, stainless steel, and mirrors. These materials, combined with the color scheme for the room, creates a cohesive and expansive space that is both simple and comfortable.</p>\n',

      "<p>As part of “THE TOKYO TOILET” Project, Kashiwa led the spatial design of a new restroom located outside the west entrance of Ebisu Station, as well as the pictograms used in all the restrooms designed for this project.Ebisu Station is a transfer station for the JR and metro lines. Its west exit is the location for the bus terminal and taxi stand, making it a popular meet-up spot and an area of heavy pedestrian traffic. This restroom was designed to be a recognizable landmark outside the exit that brings a bright and refreshing atmosphere to the area while remaining unobtrusive to daily commuters.The “pure white toilet” design depicts the cleanliness that is expected of toilets by consolidating all its components to the color white. The square building that contains four individual stalls is made from white aluminum louver that gives off a light and airy impression. This design manages to promote security from both outside and inside the restroom by allowing appropriate levels of visibility into the restroom while making sure to maintain the privacy of users in the stalls.The objective of THE TOKYO TOILET Project is to contribute to a society of cleanliness, security, harmony, and acceptance of diversity. Taking these ideals into his own hands, Kashiwa designed this public restroom as a landmark outside of the station to align with the natural standards of a public restroom and to show a new way of life.THE TOKYO TOILET Project was produced by Nippon Foundation. Restrooms are an important part of Japan’s world-class ‘omotenashi’ culture. However, many public restrooms go unused by people because the restrooms are dark, dirty, smelly, and scary. With the cooperation of the Shibuya Ward, this project aims to construct appealing restroom facilities across various locations in Shibuya Ward that everyone, regardless of age, gender, or handicaps, can comfortably use. In the 17 planned locations, each restroom is designed by one of 16 different world-renowned architects and designers. Using the power of design and creativity of these skilled individuals, this ground-breaking project is gaining notice for its endeavors to challenge and address the social issues revolving around today’s public restrooms.</p>\n",

      '<p class="p1">We oversaw the creation of a new type of sports-centered multi-purpose facility that opened in Hachinohe, Aomori prefecture, in April 2020, handling everything from the naming of the facility to the concept design, VI, and design direction. Developed as a collaboration between Hachinohe City and Xross Sports Marketing Inc., under the Xebio Group umbrella, and launched as a third sports facility to complement the existing gymnasium (in which to “do” sports) and arena (in which to “see” sports), it used these and other keywords (“support,” “helping one another,” “teaching”) to harmonize with the region’s wishes. For the launch, taking into account this new type of public-private partnership and considering that the facility was to be open to everyone, we summarized the concept of a facility that would develop sustainably along with the region in a single word: “FLAT.” Designing the logo based on the facility’s themes of “equality,” “freedom,” and “a base for the future,” we used two lines to create the impression of an “F” and typography inspired by a Japanese-style room, showing that this single facility was capable of handling a multitude of purposes by using flexible arrangements in an open space. A massive logo reminiscent of a Nazca geoglyph was deployed in the facility’s outdoor space, creating a symbol of the facility that would also enable it to be easily recognized in Google Map’s aerial photographs. In the design of the space, we also proposed placing the “FLAT-X” multipurpose space in the entrance area, connecting it to the year-round “FLAT ARENA” and the “FLAT SPACE” public indoor area to create a seamlessly interconnected outdoor-indoor environment. By condensing the facility’s concept into the “FLAT” ideal and creating a cohesive direction for the entire space, we clearly presented the new value provided by the facility.</p>\n',

Kashiwa expressed the essence of Takeda&#8217;s DNA to the world through the elaborate interior spaces. He developed the overall concept of “life force” based on what has been Takeda’s mission since its inception, namely “to strive towards better health for people worldwide through leading innovation in medicine, with the patients at the center of all that we (Takada) do.” The flow of movement from the entrance, post the reception to the working areas tells a story of human life, expressed in the eight kanji for “life”, “water”, “light”, “earth”, “trees”, “people”, “ connections”, and “future”. The characters were turned into modern designs that convey the spirit of Wa (a sense of Japanese-style harmony), which is inherent in Takeda, and applied as artwork on the walls, carpet and lighting. This project got much attention as the latest perspective of space branding, not only for communicating Takeda’s corporate identity of supporting “life force,” but for also positioning and providing spaces for all people engaging with Takeda to share the same bright future.</p>\n",

At the same time, the counter can also be used for a multitude of functions, from everyday work to meetings to product launches and other presentations. In addition, there is a hospitality room decorated with works of art by Kashiwa Sato, a meditation room with drawings from the same artist, and a creative workspace befitting an up-and-coming company that was realized through a multidimensional approach involving the space, interior, and artwork.</p>\n',

      "<p>NO NUKES NO WAR<br />\nFebruary 24, 2022: Russia invades Ukraine, followed by threats to use nuclear weapons. With tensions rising around the world, the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) in Sweden, announced that the risk of nuclear weapons being used seems higher now than at any time since the height of the Cold War, and although marginal decreases in the overall number of nuclear warheads have been realized until now, nuclear arsenals are expected to grow over the coming decade. We are currently facing the harsh reality of increasing tensions in the global security environment. As the only country to have suffered atomic bombings Japan has a special role to play in sending out a message to the world about the horrors of nuclear weapons. I have a strong sense that now is the time to send out a clear and stark message towards a world free of nuclear weapons. The poster boldly features just typography, with the message “NO NUKES NO WAR HIROSHIMA APPEALS 2022” forming the main visuals in a design featuring dynamic letters and numerals. The letter “O” and the number “0” on this poster have been stylized as yellow circles. The circular shape is described as “wa” in Japanese, which is also the same pronunciation as the Japanese word meaning peace, or harmony. As both of these words are pronounced the same way, the “wa” in this design holds a dual significance in its message to the world. It symbolizes a ray of hope for the future that we can attain peace and overcome these dark and difficult times. It is my dearest wish that each and every one of us will light up the hope in our hearts and come together so that we can spread as many rays of hope as possible, and that the activities of Hiroshima Appeals will make a contribution, however small, to world peace.<br />\nKashiwa Sato</p>\n<p>Hiroshima Appeals Poster Campaign<br />\nThe Hiroshima Appeals is a poster campaign themed on Hiroshima’s Spirit that transcends words to widely convey the prayers and wishes of Hiroshima, which experienced the ravages of the first atomic bomb used on mankind. Since 1983, with the first poster Burning Butterflies by Yusaku Kamekura, JAGDA has designated a member designer to produce a poster each year until 1990, and resumed in 2005 to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the end of World War II. The posters are presented to the mayor of Hiroshima City every year, and were presented tom member cities of Mayors of Peace in 2005 and 2008. They were also exhibited at Press Centre of G7 Hiroshima Foreign Ministers&#8217; Meeting in 2016. In this way the posters have promoted peace at home and abroad.</p>\n",

Kashiwa uniquely delivered the messages of creativity and unique perspective fostered by Mr. Ando throughout his life, with many kinds of attractions based on products such as Chicken Ramen (the first instant ramen), Cup Noodles and the Space Ramen, which Mr. Ando invented in his twilight years for eating in outer space. Unlike most corporate related museums that focus on the accomplishments of the company founder and company performance, CUPNOODLES Museum established an innovative exhibit style that communicates through hands-on attractions.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Kashiwa successfully demonstrated how a corporate museum could truly connect to branding.</span></p>\n',

    title: "IMABARI TOWEL",
    desc:
      "<p>“Imabari Towel Branding Project” was launched in 2006 as part of a Japan Ministry of Economic, Trade and Industry project to promote Japanese brands. Imabari had suffered from competition with cheap foreign products and its future was uncertain, as it was unable to recruit the next generation of workers. Kashiwa Sato created a brand identity that translated Imabari’s high value as the “safest, most reliable, and highest quality brand.” The logo Kashiwa created symbolizes the abundant nature and the revitalization of industry in the Imabari region. Positioning Imabari’s brand identity as a mark of quality assurance, Kashiwa chose a pure white towel as the key product, which embodies the essence of the brand. Kashiwa set “safest” and “most reliable” as core brand concepts, in addition to product quality, for a reason. At the time, Japanese consumers had a heightened sense of crisis due to several incidents related to food safety and to other corporate misconduct. There was a very high interest in traceability of information for food products. Kashiwa’s breakthrough was to tap into this anxiety and directly position Imabari products as being both traceable and of high quality. Red, blue and white signify the sun, ocean and water respectively, the basic foundation of Imabari Towel’s high quality. The logo, which is the initial letter ‘I’, added a European flavor and set the tone of “global-oriented brand.” The white towel had not previously been used to represent high quality, but Kashiwa felt that, as Imabari’s main product, it most clearly represented Imabari’s value. This clear and consistent message dramatically increased Imabari’s brand awareness and their sales and positioned Imabari as one of Japan’s global brands. In 2012, Kashiwa produced their first conceptual store in Minami Aoyama, Tokyo. In 2017, he also designed its flagship store in Imabari. The concept of this work is “The factory of Imabari Towel.” In order to demonstrate this concept focusing on regional towel producer of Imabari Towel in Japan, Kashiwa displayed conceptual shelf spaces decorated with longitudinal thread used in towel weaving machines, and installed artwork on the wall behind the long counter. This iconic space aims to recapture the appeal of Imabari as a towel producer. He also newly incorporated “Imabari Towel LAB,” where visitors can experience core Imabari Towel elements, “safest, most reliable, and highest quality brand.” Visitors can learn about the unique “five-second rule of towel production,” one of the most important quality assurance methods, and can enjoy challenges presented to them in quiz form extracted from the official test of “Towel Sommelier.”All these activities are helping to further the fascination and passion customers feel for the brand. The integrated creative direction of this project, which included formulating and executing the communication strategy, with the bold logo and clear brand message, as well as gaining consensus from over 100 local companies in the Imabari region, has garnered a lot of attention for revitalizing a local region in Japan through the power of design.</p>\n",

Denying traditional advertising campaign, he introduced a cool campaign method for the 10th anniversary project of SMAP, one of the leading Japanese pop groups. Bringing the new perspective that ‘a pop group is the brand’, Kashiwa re-positioned SMAP and created a communication strategy with a unique visual identity used on the CD jacket design and a variety of concert merchandise. </span><span class="s1">Kashiwa blanketed Shibuya with banners hung from the street lamps and with special designed covers for the buses in addition to newspaper ads and a poster campaign. His new idea of positioning an entire town as one big medium was highly recognized and won numerous prestigious graphic awards in 2000. Two components of the CD package, the case and the disc tray, inspired Kashiwa’s tri-colored symbolic design. He modified the position and red/blue/yellow ratio in the base design, which recalled a three-colored flag. The creation of the symbol to identify the pop group went beyond the usual production of CD jacket and concert merchandise, tapping into the trend of global companies increasing their corporate value through the power of visual identity. Witnessing the decline in the power of mass media, Kashiwa decided to forego the traditional route of heavy mass media advertising. Instead, he created a buzz through a variety of street activity; he flooded Shibuya with SMAP’s logo just before the CD launch and then ran newspaper ads featuring the tricolored flag logo with the launch date only mentioned in small print at the bottom. As planned, the mass media reported on the campaign itself, allowing Kashiwa to leverage their coverage to help spread the buzz. Kashiwa continued his strategic direction with SMAP’s next CD, ‘pamS’ (Smap inside-out) which featured only B-side titles, positioning an entire town as one medium with a specially designed car cover.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Kashiwa also produced an original beverage named after their newly released CD, “Drink Smap!” and executed more experimental advertising; he designed the beverage carrier, the workers’ coveralls, and the vending machines installed in music stores. The unconventional use of such a unique product as an advertising medium attracted a lot of attention.</span></p>\n',

      "<p>Kashiwa Sato was in charge of general creative design for a performance commemorating the name-taking ceremony of Nakamura Shikan VIII, a famous actor formerly known as Hashinosuke Nakamura III, from one of Japan&#8217;s famous kabuki families, the Narikomaya Family. Nakamura&#8217;s three sons, Hashinosuke IV, Fukunosuke III and Utanosuke IV also celebrated name-taking ceremonies at the same time as their father. Along with designing the stage drop curtain, Kashiwa designed and produced special logos for each actor. These designs, which included and integrated family look, were used on tenugui hand cloths, furoshiki wrapping cloths, original badges and stickers. While commemorating the long history of this kabuki family, Kashiwa instilled a colorful modern feel into the unique occasion of simultaneous name-taking ceremonies for &#8220;a father and 3 sons.&#8221; In October 2016, Kashiwa Sato drew a very dynamic brush painting on the celebratory drop curtain at the Kabukiza Theater in Tokyo. It told a story of how the &#8220;new Shikan VIII is protecting his Narikomaya Family.&#8221; In the following November, he created four types of logos for a celebratory drop curtain, which incorporated a touch of colorful contemporary style. This was a joyous occasion as it was a celebration for four people within the same family, each with their own integrated logo. These designs were used on stickers as well. In January 2017, at a celebratory name-taking performance, Kashiwa designed an original Shikan VIII logo based on the traditional &#8220;Shikan Design&#8221; and modified and designed each son&#8217;s name based on Japanese hiragana characters. These designs were used in the celebratory drop curtain, tenugui hand cloths and noren curtains. They will also be used in other items in the future. Kashiwa was the first-ever creative director dealing with a kabuki name-taking ceremony within its 400-year history. He has successfully embodied the quintessence of kabuki, which has made this tradition a living heritage in modern-day Japan, into his designs, but also expresses a sense of the times within.</p>\n",

    desc:
      "<p>ARITA 400project was launched in 2016 to commemorate the 400-year anniversary of Arita porcelain and to further propel Arita porcelain into the international limelight. Kashiwa Sato collaborated, as a guest creator, with several porcelain producers in Arita. The concept of Kashiwa&#8217;s work was “DISSIMILAR”, where he used the &#8216;splash paint&#8217; technique to express a fusion of extremely different or opposite images, namely “design by logic”, based on elaborate design, and “design by accident”, based on chance. These works were first exhibited at the Maison &amp; Objet fair in Paris in January 2016 and at Tokyo’s Isetan Shinjuku in the following October. Invited to lend his unique approach to design for ARITA 400project, Kashiwa honored Arita’s iconic image with an inventive twist on art, design, and method. His creative prowess and the application of his approach across each product have opened the doors for others to embrace a whole new world of Arita porcelain. In 1616 Korean potter Yi Sam-pyeong discovered porcelain clay near Mount Izumi in Arita and started to make porcelain ware. According to history, this Arita porcelain was the first porcelain to be made in Japan. It is now known the world over for its lucid whiteness and intricate hand-painted designs, and has been prized throughout Japan and by European aristocracy and royals from the 17<sup>th</sup> century onward. ARITA 400project was launched in 2016 to commemorate the 400-year anniversary of Arita porcelain and to further propel Arita porcelain into the international limelight. Kashiwa Sato collaborated, as a guest creator, with several porcelain producers in Arita. In his first project with local porcelain producer KIHARA, Kashiwa splashed paints as a base design, and then placed geometric gold leafing on the porcelain surface to create thirteen 60cm plates. These works were first exhibited at the Maison &amp; Objet fair in Paris in January 2016. Kashiwa also designed the display booth, using “motion typography” to create a coherent space in which to demonstrate his idea. Kashiwa went on to work with eight other porcelain producers. Using <em>gosu</em>, a cobalt pigment used to create shades of indigo blue, which is made from a secret recipe handed down from generation to generation, he created a special method to splash paint on to the porcelain. The concept of Kashiwa&#8217;s work was “DISSIMILAR” the fusion of extremely different or opposite images: chance and inevitability, chaos and tranquility, past and future, timeless and fleeting, and innovative and traditional. This is design both by accident and by logic. This reflects a desire to preserve the best of Arita porcelain techniques and its great history, while also presenting a new innovative image of Arita porcelain heading into the future. Kashiwa presented a totally new perspective of methods of creation with his “iconic branding”, an inventive twist on art, design and craft, within the context of local and global, and what is now a world of increasingly diverse values.</p>\n",

    desc:
      "<p>Aoki Shuzo’s 300 year celebration Sake KAKUREI Jyunmai-Daiginjyo special edition ‘TSURUKUBI (Fukuro-tori)’, and ‘YUKIDAMA’ bottles are designed by creative director Kashiwa Sato. TSURUKUBI, meaning crane neck, is inspired by its slender figure. It also evokes the image of Japanese classic Sake decanter Tokkuri, with the soft curve and the delicate neck. After various trials, Sato finally found the best asymmetric shape. In order to finish the 100 limited bottles unique, he decided to approach without using the mass product method. Thus led him to self paint cobalt oxide Gosu on every Arita ware porcelain, bringing one and only scenery on each bottles. After one and a half month from May 2017, his hand painted memorial bottles finished the firing process, bringing the vivid and graceful Gosu blue. TSURUKUBI presents dark blue snowflake “crystals” on bright white porcelain, with the tricentennial “0” motif gild. The contrast of blue, gold, and white shows the exquisite beauty. The elegant gold color gives a good tension, to celebrate the brewer’s 300th anniversary. Another special edition YUKIDAMA, meaning snowball, relates to the location of Aoki Shuzo, rooted in snowy Minami Uonuma area, Niigata prefecture. The soft and firm white porcelain, like a rolled fresh snow in your hand. In contrast to the cold snow, the distinct round form of YUKIDAMA gives warm feelings. As the actual snowballs would never be a true round, this bottle has the adorable organic distortion, and its shape matches the outstanding Sato’s hand painted Gosu blue. Arita ware and Sato have been collaborating since “ARITA400” project. But this was the first time for him to design a bottle from its shape. He says “I was finally able to complete my ambition”. With the previous project, he used the drip and splash method on large platters with Gosu, challenging the existing standards. Although he explains “After dripping Gosu on thousands of platters, I figured the characteristics of the material”. You can find the diverse expressions through the porcelain, beauty of the slow drop of blue, and a powerful gush of the patterns. Creating a porcelain means facing fire and minerals, which is the nature, that human will never be able to control entirely. Sato calls it “Design by accident”. On the other hand, he has built his creative director career with the intelligent design thinking (Design by logic), but he says those two ideas aren’t conflicting. “Through my past works I had been trying to achieve logical systems and structures with communication, and designing icons. With those experiences, I became capable of embracing and controlling accidents like this time, during the production” he says. His youth blood aiming to be a painter, and the mastering time of medium designs, were blended and matured, then accidentally, a blue flower bloomed. Aoki Shuzo’s sake brewing is also based on nature, confronting harsh winter cold, rice, water, and malt. It is obvious that the memorial sake bottle was designed and crafted with the best method.</p>\n",

In light of potential expansion of the company&#8217;s product line-up, in response to increasingly diversified consumer eating habits, Kashiwa proposed a simplified company name, changing &#8220;Miwa Somen Yamamoto&#8221; to &#8220;Miwa Yamamoto.&#8221; He expressed the company&#8217;s rich history, dating back more than 300 years and intertwined with the ancient city of Nara, within a new logo based on the company&#8217;s seal design. &#8220;Hakuryu&#8221; packaging is white, simple and modern, differentiating it from competitor products, which tend to use brush-written lettering on their packaging. The sharp product logo is symbolic of the unique and refined level of skills behind Miwa Yamamoto&#8217;s ultrafine noodles.</p>\n",

The role of the hospital to provide a facility where patients who are on the road to recovery preparing to return to their ordinary lives with full energy and confidence, is overlapped with that of a resort where people go to refresh their body and soul. Kashiwa organized a team of leading innovative professionals, including Sadahiro Nakamura (new category of “producer” creating cultural playgrounds, like cafes, shops and shared offices), Yoshitaka Haba (innovative “book director” creating bookstores, distributing and making books), and Naoki Takizawa (new “fashion designer” proposing new possibility of fashion design), to realize this concept. A book called “Book Therapy” was also published to help people discover the new possibilities of rehabilitation. A new vision and concept, derived from the power of creativity, was proposed for rehabilitation and hospitals. Kashiwa also produced the total plan to renovate Senri Rehabilitation Hospital’s new cerebral stroke ward, built in commemoration of the hospital’s 10<sup>th</sup> anniversary. He expanded the “Rehabilitation Resort” concept to provide an environment where patients could relax and focus well on their rehabilitation. Kashiwa incorporated the ideas of Ms. Yasuko Hashimoto, founder of the hospital, using timber both inside and outside of the building to create warmth and enable patients to feel the healing power of nature. A music room and art room, with timber tiling, were also set up as part of the hospital’s new program. Drawing and Arita porcelain, personally created by Kashiwa, are exhibited in the lobby and beyond, providing patients the energy of art as a type of new therapy.</p>\n",

      '<p class="p1">Samurai Incubate’s logo, action guidelines, and space creations are all aligned around the graceful, unembellished sense of aesthetics unique to Japan. First off, we have reorganized our action guidelines around the words, “Ambition, Courage, Courtesy, Integrity.” Our logo mark symbolizes those four words in a design stripped down to its bare essentials. The four squares, arranged in an orderly line, represent the new, steadfast foundation on which we will build our business going forward, and we have deliberately set charcoal as our corporate color to display our intention to support the creation of businesses in a full range of new colors. Believing that our new office, at which we will provide operational support from the seed stage and give birth to new businesses, should be as close as possible to a void, we have taken an existing three-story building situated amidst a row of skyscrapers in Roppongi 1-chome and removed its various accoutrements, returning it as much as possible to the status of a newly completed building under a “whole space” concept. The second floor, which takes its inspiration from a martial arts dojo, changes its shape to suit a multitude of purposes from events to seminars to use as a coworking space, allowing for a variety of new things to be tried. It is this place in particular that symbolizes the multifunctional nature of Samurai Incubate. Those using the space remove their shoes as they would in a Japanese-style room for the wide, high-quality wood planks, creating a moment of the unexpected amidst mundane daily life. The unbroken white surface along one wall delivers a strong yet dignified message, symbolizing creation from nothingness, and serves as an important icon for the room. As the base for a company that continues to work with sure and fast footwork, the other spaces were also designed aiming for a light, simple atmosphere, meticulously arranging a minimalistic selection of “elemental” materials―wood, stainless steel, cloth, and glass―in unified, unpartitioned spaces.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>\n',

Along with creating and planning the business concept and brand logo, Kashiwa also designed the interior space, utensils and original drawings used within “Yakitori Tsukada”, the company’s latest restaurant that opened in Tokyo’s Nakameguro and specializes in grilled skewered chicken. A. P. Company has been operating “Tukada Nojo (Tsukada Farm)”, a rapidly growing and successful chain of eating and drinking establishments serving locally produced chicken at an affordable price. However, with competitors mimicking the Tsukada business model and changing customer tastes, the power of the Tsukada brand had been decreasing. The keyword within the rebranding and development of the new brand concept was “Rare-Mass”, a newly fabricated word combining the opposite ideas of “one and only” with “mass people.” Leveraging Tsukada’s strength of its “direct farm to consumer model”, which has enabled its restaurants to serve chicken directly sourced from poultry farms, the aim was to establish a consumer position in the middle between “mass”, as seen in large chain restaurants, and “individual”, as seen in specialty restaurants serving the rich. The aim as to satisfy a consumer needs to easily enjoy luxury. “Yakitori Tsukada” is the first restaurant to embody this concept, where highly skilled chefs cook and serve yakitori, using parts of rare local free-range chickens, and consumers can enjoy a glass or two of selected premium wine along with their yakitori. The facade and interior incorporate simple materials like cedar, stainless steel and glass, while high quality Arita porcelain dishes created a premium atmosphere, giving this restaurant both a unique and distinguished edge.</p>\n",

      "<p>Kashiwa Sato was in charge of the planning and execution of new branding strategy including changing the company name and developing a new corporate identity for &#8220;MoltBene,&#8221; a large Japanese company dealing with professional hair-care products. The new mission statement he created was &#8220;New Beauty Experience of Life.” He also integrated Group subsidiaries under this new slogan and the new company name &#8220;beauty experience.&#8221; The new logo designed by Kashiwa as inspired by the form of kanji character for beauty &#8220;美.&#8221; He designed the entrance to the new corporate headquarters, the interior design of its beauty studio, and was responsible for the artwork installed. The binding image throughout was &#8220;美.&#8221; Kashiwa Sato was asked to propose a new corporate identity for the renowned Japanese hair-care company &#8220;MoltBene&#8221; in commemoration of its 40th year. Based on interviews with Mr. Toshihiro Fukui, the founder of the company, Kashiwa created a new mission statement of &#8220;New Beauty Experience of Life.&#8221; Utilizing the image of kanji character &#8220;美,&#8221; meaning &#8220;beauty,&#8221; as the symbol mark, Kashiwa transformed the statement into a logo and used the color purple as the company&#8217;s new corporate color. This distinguishes the uniqueness of the company, as purple is not a color often used within corporate logos. Kashiwa was also in charge of designing the company&#8217;s new beauty studio within its new head office. Used for staff training, meetings with the press and so forth, the space was designed to be in sync with overall branding strategy. Fabrics handing from the ceiling of the studio and drawings by Kashiwa on the walls of the studio express the positioning of this studio as a birthplace of a new beauty experience. By symbolically incorporating the new mission statement in the new company name, new logo, new interior of the beauty studio and other new communication tools such as stationary and company goods, all these elements have merged to propose a new branding methodology to society.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

      "<p>Kashiwa Sato worked with one of Japan’s most prominent poets, Shuntaro Tanikawa, to co-author and published “E-ji-e-ji-e-ji-ji-e”. With a theme of “a picture book enjoyable from babyhood,” Kashiwa was in charge of the visual aspect while Tanikawa looked after the words. Kashiwa started off by trying to create dynamic drawings what visualized the unleashing of a baby or child’s primordial energy. Tanikawa would then compose prose, based on Kashiwa’s works, incorporating hiragana, katakana, kanji and Roman characters. Kashiwa also tried to integrate art, graphics and editorial design into this collaborative work, superimposing digital graphics over artistic drawings, and then positioning Tanikawa’s text. The two deliberately did not meet while working on this book, preferring to mutually inspire creativity through each other’s visuals and texts, before then re-integrating new ideas. This total design process gave birth to a new definition for a picture book, where there is not separation between picture and text.</p>\n",

      "<p>Kashiwa Sato produced a total branding strategy for DIFFERENCE, a new suit ordering system launched in 2016. He created the name, logo, products, in-store design and the overall ordering system. Kashiwa proposed an innovative method where upon having initial measurement taken by an in-store tailor and saved into a unique mobile app, all other parts of the ordering process right up to delivery can be done using the app. This built a totally new service model, linking real and online shops, creating a brand new suit ordering experience. Konaka, one of Japan&#8217;s leading men&#8217;s suite companies, wanted to launch a new product in order to handle an increase in fashion awareness toward work clothes, the casualization of work apparel and demand for custom-made suits. Kashiwa proposed a breakthrough idea using the smartphone from ordering to deliver. Customers need only visit a shop for initial measuring, with all other data and communication being done via their smartphone. This helped to dramatically decrease the number of shops and also provided Konaka with an avenue to execute individual promotions in accordance with each customer&#8217;s data and to analyze data provided. The model built provided convenience for the customer, along with maximizing the benefits of a custom-made suit. The first shop opened in October 2016 in Aoyama, with Kashiwa designing a chic and sophisticated interior space. The app enabled the shop to ask customers, in advance, for their personal preferences and budget, allowing them to display different suit options and fabric samples so that the customer could actually touch and feel their &#8220;would-be&#8221; suit once they visit the shop. Customers have a seamless experience between the real shop and the virtual one. Many customers have welcomed this service as everyone can enjoy high-quality service and personalization throughout the entire process. Konaka is gradually rolling out new stores providing this service and sales are also growing at a steady pace.</p>\n",
